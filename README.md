For [natHACKS 2023](https://nathacks23.devpost.com/) focused on brain-to-text and speech-to-text capabilities.

///

## Intro
Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) equipment allows people to connect with their environment and other people with greater awareness and capability. CogLog has produced a SAAS called Cerecode that leverages BCI technology to convert brain wave readings into spoken speech. This gives people who have limited or decreasing speech capabilities a way to communicate more clearly with those around them. More specifically, Cerecode utilizes models from the open-source [dataset](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.x69p8czpq) associated with [_"A high-performace speech neruprosthesis"_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06377-x.pdf) which focuses on decoding phonemes from intracortical microelectrode arrays. 

## Usage
Client-Side:
`npm install`
`npm run dev`

Model + Backend:
1. Do x
2. Do y
3. Do z
4. Have fun!
